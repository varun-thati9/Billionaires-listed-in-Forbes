# Billionaires-listed-in-Forbes
I took this project from the Kaggle
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujalluhar/billionaires-listed-in-forbes
This is a classification problem and I have done Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
Among these all algorithms and techniques I achieved best accuracy by Random Forest and I have made pickle file using Random Forest as my final model for predictions.
